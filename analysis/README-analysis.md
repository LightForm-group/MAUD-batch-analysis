Example Analysis
-----------

Example MAUD analysis files can be downloaded from a [Zenodo release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602926) to accompany the MAUD-batch-analysis package. Please download these analysis files and unzip them into the MAUD-batch-analysis package, to run an example analysis with MAUD batch mode.

The [Zenodo release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602926) includes both Diamond 2017 and Diamond 2021 analysis files.

The Diamond 2021 analysis files can also be downloaded from [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Analysis - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311323)
