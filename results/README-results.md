Example Results
-----------

Example result files can be downloaded from a [Zenodo release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602926) to accompany the MAUD-batch-analysis package. Please download these results files and unzip them into the 'results/' folder in the MAUD-batch-analysis package, to see example texture results using MAUD batch mode.

The [Zenodo release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602926) includes both Diamond 2017 and Diamond 2021 results files.

The Diamond 2021 results files can also be downloaded from [Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Ti-6Al-4V Hot-Rolled Sample Matrices using Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (Results Dataset)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7477473)
