Example Data
-----------

Example data files can be downloaded from a [Zenodo release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602926) to accompany the MAUD-batch-analysis package. Please download these data files and unzip them into the 'data/' folder in the MAUD-batch-analysis package, to run an example analysis with MAUD batch mode.

The [Zenodo release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602926) includes both Diamond 2017 and Diamond 2021 caked .dat files, as well as .cif files for the alpha and beta phase

The Diamond 2021 caked .dat files can also be downloaded from [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Analysis - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311323)

The caking of these data files was done using the [pyFAI-integration-caking](https://github.com/LightForm-group/pyFAI-integration-caking) package.
