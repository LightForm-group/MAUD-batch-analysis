    "The goniometer sample rotation angles ${\\omega, \\chi, \\phi}$ refer to sample rotations around the X (RD - rolling direction), Z (ND - normal direction) and Y (TD - transverse direction) axes, respectively. For synchrotron x-ray diffraction, the 0, 0, 0 orientation is such that X (RD) is aligned parrallel with the top of the detector, Z (ND) is aligned along the in-beam direction, Y (TD) is aligned with  the side of the detector. By applying sequential rotations it is possible to align a sample with any given orientation.\n",

The pole figure (PF) convention in MAUD is that the right of the PF is the X (RD) direction, or the top of the detector, the top of the PF is the Z (ND) direction, or the in-beam direction, and the centre of the PF is the Y (TD) direction, or the side of the detector. Therefore, it is possible to correctly reorientate the subset pole figure coverage recorded by the diffraction pattern ring intensities during an experiment."
